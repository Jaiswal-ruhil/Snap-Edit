Snap-Edit
=========
A bare bones line-by-line text editor with a command-line interface written in C.
Uses a linked list type structure. Compile sit.c with a C compiler and use the executable.

I hereby place it under public domain, do what you will with it.
Just don't hold me responsible for anything.
